# Unit 4 Project
Windows and Linux users can find pre-compiled binaries in [`./bin/`](./bin/). Installation instructions are avaliable for both Windows and Linux users.
Windows users also have the option of using an installer.

Users wishing to compile the application themselves will find the C# source code as well as compilation instructions in [`./src/`](./src/).
